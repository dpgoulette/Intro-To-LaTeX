# Intro-To-LaTeX
An informal introduction to LaTeX that I wrote when I taught LaTeX to students in the college of science at SJSU.  It is definitely a work in progress.  There are likely many typos, errors etc.  I wrote it on the fly as I taught the course.

These documents began as suplements to a live lecture and some video lectures (which are currently not available).  So there are some places where I may assume the reader has attended one of my lectures.  (But if you are reading this, you likely did not.)  So I apologize if I gloss over something or give short shrift to something that doesn't make sense to you.  Feel free to shoot me an email if you have a question, suggestion etc. (of course, replace the "at" and "dot" with @ and . -- I'm happy to give my email to real people... not bots):

Each directory/folder in this repository holds a different mini-book.  Each one contains a .pdf file and the .tex file that generated that .pdf.  (If you are completely new to LaTeX, .tex files are the files that you actually edit.  Then LaTeX turns this .tex file and generates a .pdf.)  I want you to have the source file and the result so you can learn from them side-by-side.  If you see something I did in .pdf and you want to find out how I did it, then just check out the associated .tex file.

## What to read first? second? etc.
If you are completely new to LaTeX then begin by reading intro.pdf
