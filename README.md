# Intro-To-LaTeX
An informal introduction to LaTeX that I wrote when I taught LaTeX to students in the college of science at SJSU.  It is definitely a work in progress.  There are likely many typos, errors etc.  I wrote it on the fly as I taught the course.

These documents began as suplements to a live lecture and some video lectures (which are currently not available).  So there are some places where I may assume the reader has attended one of my lectures.  (But if you are reading this, you likely did not.)  So I apologize if I gloss over something or give short shrift to something that doesn't make sense to you.  Feel free to shoot me an email if you have a question, suggestion etc.:
