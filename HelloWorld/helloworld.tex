% It is best to read a .tex file like this one with a text editor that shows you line numbers.
% Any line in this document that starts with a % is a comment in the code that has no effect the final document.


%The code on line one above just tells LaTeX what type of document this is going to be.  Don't worry about it now.  I explain more about this in the main intro to latex document.

\begin{document}

\end{document}
